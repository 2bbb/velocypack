* Handle strange special case in \uXXXX for the non-standard planes,
  which do two adjacent \uXXXX to produce two UTF-16 surrogates (MN).
  --> done, only needed in parser, dumper can ignore

* add RapidJson to bench for comparisons (JS)
  --> done, run bench with "rapidjson" as last parameter

* optionally check for repeated attribute names in the same subobject (JS)
  --> functionality is implemented, duplicate attribute name checking is
      turned off by default, but can be enabled by setting a parser option

* compare against TRI_json_t (JS)
  --> done for small.json and sample.json. Jason is 2 to 3 times faster

* Handle numbers that cannot be represented safely in int64/uint64/double in JasonParser (JS)

* Finish implementation of JasonSlice for all types (JS)

* handle unsupported JSON types in JasonDumper (JS)

* add pretty printing option to dumper (JS)

* implement BCD in Builder, Slice, Parser and Dumper

* implement optional lookup table support in Builder, Slice, Parser and Dumper

* test long variants (presumably just use > 255 entries)

* test arrays/objects with few but long elements that exceed 64 KB

* decide if JasonBuffer should be used in JasonBuilder

* support shrinking

* support modification of Jason objects

* optional: support accessing arbitrary objects via JSONPointer etc.

* optional: support for other input encodings (e.g. UTF-16)
