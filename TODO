* Parser: switchable sorting
  - parser already has a JasonOption sortAttributeNames,
    and it seems to be honored. Builder also accepts the
    option and creates either sorted or unsorted objects.
    Seems no further action is required.

* Parser: switchable UTF-8 validation
  - already added JasonOptions.validateUtf8Strings, but it
    still needs to be honored. Finally, the compile option
    JASON_VALIDATEUTF8 needs to be removed.
  - need tests with UTF-8 validation turned on and off
