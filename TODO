* External:
  0x08      : external (only in memory): a char* and a size_t pointing to the
              actual place in memory

  Isn't it sufficient to use only the char* when handling Externals?
  The length of an external can always be calculated by dereferencing the 
  External's char* pointer and peeking at the referenced Jason.
  Using just char* instead of a pair of char* and size_t allows for a more
  compact representation. Omitting the length also allows keeping the Jason 
  struct as small as it currently is. For storing the length it would need
  to be extended by a size_t.

  Right, done.

* Strings:  
  0x40-0xbf : UTF-8-string, using V-0x40 bytes (not Unicode-Characters!), 
              length 0 is possible, so 0x40 is the empty string,
              maximal length is 127
  0xc0-0xc7 : long UTF-8-string, next V-0xbf bytes are length of string 
              in bytes

  There are two string types, but internally they share the same enum value 
  JasonType::String. This is different to arrays and objects, where there
  are separate types for short and long array/objects. Is this intentional?

  Right, done.

* Strings:
  specification should state that string and binary value are not null-
  terminated.

  Right, done.
